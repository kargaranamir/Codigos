# Solved geek for geeks and UVA problems 
These are my assignments for the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms, mostly their gathered from Uva resourcers with the same title so one can easily find the questions. The area which these assignments where mostly focused on was Devide and Conquer algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Network and Graph algorithms, and Greedy Algorithms.
